# My name is Oscar....

I am born 2nd May 2003 in Germany,
and I started out Programming with creating some **Minecraft modifications,** 
most of them (almost all) didn't really publish
as i was just 13-15 and i didn't have the motivation and time to keep going and programm all day.

### What has been motivating me

It always has started for me with a little curiousity and then just straight up learning most of the stuff of some docs or wiki's for whatever i was trying to learn.
At some point i got into 3d modeling with blender (not that advanced but good enough to make some models) , Video editing with Premiere Pro/Sony Vegas 13 and Image
editing with Gimp at first and then moving on to photoshop.

### Gaming, Youtube and Video editing

My Alt Name for Gaming is Oscarita25/Modn4rstuff/Yummymuffin25.
I have created some Youtube Channels but most of them were stupid attempts at doing something i didn't want to put effort in.
those the ones what i am pretty ok with sharing, the other ones are pretty easy to find with my alt names and are kind of cringe (forgot the password and can't delete):

#### The Channel maily for my gaming:
