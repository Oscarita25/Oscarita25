# My name is Oscar and i am a developer that like to create just stuff that interests me.



I am a Programmer and even more a Gamer.
I started out with creating some Minecraft mods, most of them (almost all) didn't really publish as i am a lazy person and that was just a hobby.
It always has started for me with a little curiousity and then just straight up learning most of the stuff of some docs or wiki's for whatever i was trying to learn.
At some point i got into 3d modeling with blender (not that advanced but good enough to make some models) , Video editing with Premiere Pro/Sony Vegas 13 and Image
editing with Gimp at first and then moving on to photoshop.
